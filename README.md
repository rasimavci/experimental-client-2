## Introduction
This app comes tries to build a minimal webRTC client for mobile using kandy.js

After all, I learned Vue for a while, and I tried to be familier more about the Vue ecosystem
After reading some guides in their official site, I just want to try my chance.

So I decided to build this new mobile client

## Development
This project can be used as personal cloud note
**please install node.js if you have not yet**
**please deploy kandy.js API first**

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## PS
**my code is not very indentation, please remind me the issues you have found**
